# Environment variables

The app instance could be customized by passing following variables to NodeJS environment at runtime. See their list below.

**IMPORTANT NOTE!** For _production_ build purposes all json-like values should be single-quoted. If it contains a hash (`#`) or a dollar-sign (`$`) the whole value should be wrapped in single quotes as well (see `dotenv` [readme](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#variable-substitution))

# How to add new environment variable

If the variable should be exposed to the browser don't forget to add prefix `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to its name.

These are the steps that you have to follow to make everything work:
- create the variable placeholder for build-time in file `.env.template`; this is the most important step, without this the app will not receive any variables that are passed at run-time
- for local development purposes add the variable to either `configs/envs/.env.common` or `configs/envs/.env.<network>` files depending on if the variable has the same value for all network or specific value for each network
- add the variable to CI configs
    - `deploy/values/review/values.yaml` - review environment
    - `deploy/values/main/values.yaml` - production environment
    - `deploy/values/e2e/values.yaml` - e2e-test environment

Keep in mind that all json-like values should be single-quoted, e.g `[{'foo': 'bar'}]`
